        <p>Our ideal school starts at 9 o'clock and finishes at 4 p.m.</p>
        <p>For five hours students partecipate at lessons and for last two hours they can do their homework.</p>
        <p>They are classrooms for each subject and , when an hour finishes, students must change room within 10 minutes. </p>
        <p>Sometimes, when the weather is sunny, lessons can be done outside, indeed school offers a spacious garden which is cared every day</p>
